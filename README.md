This program uses an API key to determine whether party cohesion has increased, decreased, or stayed the same. 

It determines the votes with party percentage (how often politicians voted for or against their party). 

Individual members of Congress usually vote with their party, resulting in higher percentages.

The API key is stored in key.txt.
